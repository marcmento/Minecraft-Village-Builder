# Minecraft Village Builder
In this project we used the minecraft python API to automatically build a village in minecraft. We split the village up into three sections and created them individually. These sections include
* Terrain
* Paths
* Houses

We then combined these three sections together to create our final village builder. In all sections we use many algorithms and techniques to not only ensure that the villages are built properly but also to ensure they are random.
## Run
To run this project you first need to ensure you have the minecraft side set up properly on your local computer. This includes making your server compatiable with the minecraft API. Once this is done simply run the village file and watch a new village be created around your minecraft player.
